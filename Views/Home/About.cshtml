            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>
                We run an outdoor adventure course featuring a zip line, an obstacle course among the trees,
                a mountain bike downhill track, and a panorama restaurant perched at the top of the hill.
                Our resort is focused on sustainability, fresh air, and giving visitors a true sky-high experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                To connect with our community, we host a review section where visitors can leave comments and feedback.
                These reviews double as entries into our regular lottery — where top prizes include a free weekend stay.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                With a limited client pool due to our niche offerings, we’ve embraced the cloud.
                We built this .NET MVC platform hosted on Azure to handle and display reviews.
                Reviews are stored securely in MongoDB via a Docker container and help us engage our customers better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our entire setup — from reverse-proxied Nginx to VM-based infrastructure — is optimized for both safety and scalability.

            <h2>Technology & Transparency</h2>
            <p>
                This site is more than a webpage — it's a full-stack cloud solution. 
                Reviews submitted here are processed in real time, validated, stored in MongoDB, and displayed seamlessly.
                Every part of the pipeline — from form input to database — is designed to be transparent, reliable, and secure.
