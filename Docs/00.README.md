## A note on the structure of this project:

- This is an assignment that will be turned in as a .pdf eventually.
- The work here reflects that: the code is only to set up a MVC project and basic CI/CD pipelines.

### Important files

- 00.README.md : this file! Includes the basic instructions
- All the numbered files (01., 02., et c. are primarily .sh format for presentational purposes, they could be .md or anything but I wanted the styling that comes with the script format). Their purpose is to present the code templates that is used in the final .pdf. During development I have been commented in/out code in those files to "partially script" sections.
